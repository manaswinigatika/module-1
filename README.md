## **Project Files**

- **ass1_dining_xgboost.ipynb**: Develops an **XGBoost-based model** to predict a customerâ€™s favorite dish based on dining preferences and behavior. It includes **data preprocessing, feature engineering, one-hot encoding, and time-aware model training**. The model ensures real-world applicability by handling missing data, optimizing hyperparameters, and evaluating performance using **accuracy, log loss, and feature importance analysis**.

- **training_and_features.py**: Preprocesses data, generates features, and trains the **XGBoost model** for dish recommendations.

- **demo.py**: A **Streamlit app** that uses the trained model to predict dishes and display personalized discounts based on user inputs.

- **featureimportance.png**: Visual representation of **feature importance analysis** from the trained model.
